## Meet Our Team
## Javier Figueira
![Javier F.](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/6a9762ae-b1dd-430e-a2d1-2f63d37327ef)

I am Javier Figueira, I have 17 years of age, I turn 18 in may 15 and Im in eleventh grade. I have two brothers who are older than me. I think that robotics is a interesting and unique hobby where you can learn a lot of things, like programming or building the robot. I also do karate and music outside of the school. Im in two bands right now, with those being: Asther and The Crickets. I also teach karate classes every monday, wednesday and friday. Although teaching can be kinda hard, I still love teaching karate.
## Mariano Pertuz

My name is Mariano Pertuz, I am 15 years old, and I enjoy playing video games. I also like to learn more about robotics. In my free time, I practice jiu-jitsu. During class time, I strive to study and learn from my mistakes. When I was little, I practiced swimming and won swimming medals, but over time I started to not like swimming anymore, and I left it behind.
## Juan Dario Smith

My name is Juan Darío Smith Quijano, and I'm 15 years old. I enjoy soccer and volleyball. I'm also part of my Robotics and Debate groups. I'm in the 10th grade of PAS Sciences. I'm enthusiastic, fun, and a good teammate who helps my classmates. I'm cheerful. I enjoy traveling, playing video games, and spending time with my family.

Robot Component Map
1. Central Unit (Hub): Brain of the robot, Receives and processes sensor data and Sends commands to motors
2. Motors: Drive Motors: Provide movement to the wheels (left and right), Steering Motor (if separate): Controls direction or steering mechanism
3. Sensors: Color Sensor: Detects colors and light intensity, Ultrasonic Sensor: Measures distance to obstacles
4. Motors: Steering Motor (Direction Control Motor):
Controls the steering mechanism of the robot and raction Motors (Drive or Propulsion Motors):
Provide the main movement (forward and backward) connected to the wheels or tracks and Control the speed and acceleration of the robot.
5. Wheels and Tires:
Provide traction and mobility
Connected to drive motors

 ## Robot Track Practice
![Practice1](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/2f6b08c6-20e2-46a2-8ba7-7729f4d60b95)

 PRACTICE: Test the Robot on the Track.
OBJECTIVE: Test the robot on the practice track to verify that all of its functions are working correctly.

## Mission Robotics
WRO ® Future Engineers: This involves creating a robot based on our creativity, which can navigate a track for three laps with different obstacles, avoid walls, and park the robot. The robot also needs to solve specific challenges on a track based on the year's theme and age group.
