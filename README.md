## Javier Figueira
![Javier F.](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/6a9762ae-b1dd-430e-a2d1-2f63d37327ef)

I am Javier Figueira, I have 17 years of age, I turn 18 in may 15 and Im in eleventh grade. I have two brothers who are older than me. I think that robotics is a interesting and unique hobby where you can learn a lot of things, like programming or building the robot. I also do karate and music outside of the school. Im in two bands right now, with those being: Asther and The Crickets. I also teach karate classes every monday, wednesday and friday. Although teaching can be kinda hard, I still love teaching karate.

My name is Juan Darío Smith Quijano, and I'm 15 years old. I enjoy soccer and volleyball. I'm also part of my Robotics and Debate groups. I'm in the 10th grade of PAS Sciences. I'm enthusiastic, fun, and a good teammate who helps my classmates. I'm cheerful. I enjoy traveling, playing video games, and spending time with my family.

Robot Component Map
1. Central Unit (Hub): Brain of the robot, Receives and processes sensor data and Sends commands to motors
2. Motors: Drive Motors: Provide movement to the wheels (left and right), Steering Motor (if separate): Controls direction or steering mechanism
Arm/Lift 
3. Sensors: Color Sensor: Detects colors and light intensity, Ultrasonic Sensor: Measures distance to obstacles
4. Motors: Steering Motor (Direction Control Motor):
Controls the steering mechanism of the robot and raction Motors (Drive or Propulsion Motors):
Provide the main movement (forward and backward) connected to the wheels or tracks and Control the speed and acceleration of the robot.
5. Wheels and Tires:
Provide traction and mobility
Connected to drive motors
